Advent of Code 2023 in clojure. I usually last a week or so.

## Running Tests

```bash
lein test
```

## Days

### Day 1 - Done.

With help [from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1884fpl/2023_day_1for_those_who_stuck_on_part_2/) on part 2, both on what the catch was and a clean way to handle it. I ended up rewriting my code to use [u/EyedMoon's](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1884fpl/2023_day_1for_those_who_stuck_on_part_2/kbiywz6/) much better idea.
